Designed and implemented both frontend and backend functionalities for an online movie browsing and purchasing platform. Utilized PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated a database system to manage movie information and update stock levels upon user purchases
The Backend functionalities where implemented using PHP and I am using a MYSQL database in order to be able to store my movies and user information because the user needs to be loggend in in order to be able to acess the website. 
In order to implement the Frontend I used HTML CSS and JavaScript to validate the forms.
